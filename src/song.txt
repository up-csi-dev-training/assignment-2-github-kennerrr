"Subway"

I saw your green hair
Beauty mark next to your mouth
There on the subway
I nearly had a breakdown
A few weeks later
Somebody wore your perfume
It almost killed me
I had to leave the room

It's just another day
And it's not over 'til it's over
Oh it's never over
It's just another day
And it's not over 'til it's over
It's never over

'Til I don't look for you on the staircase
I'll wish you still thought we were soulmates
I'm still counting down all of the days
'Til you're just another girl on the subway

Made you the villain
Evil for just moving on
I see your shadow
I see it even with the lights off
I made a promise, if in four months this feeling ain't gone
Well, fuck this city, I'm movin' to Saskatchewan

It's just another day
And it's not over 'til it's over
It's never over
It's just another day
And it's not over 'til it's over
It's never over

'Til I can break routine during foreplay
And trust myself that I won't say your name
Yeah, I'm still counting down all of the days
'Til you're just another girl on the subway

She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
She got, she got away
She got away, she got away
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
She got, she got away
She got away, she got away
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
She got, she got away
She got away, she got away
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
She got, she got away
She got away, she got away
